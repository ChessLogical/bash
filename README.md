Bash Scripts for the discerning coder. Keep in mind that in Bash, dealing with very large files is problematic due to memory concerns. Bash is powerful  and awesome- just stay in ur lane and expect reasonable results! If you have any useful bash scripts feel free to share! I switch from windows to linux for learning purposes, and for a long time i will be back to coding for windows, so this repo will not be updated for a while.
